# Race Control TV

Android TV application to watch content from [F1 TV](https://f1tv.formula1.com).

At this time, only live or replay content from the current season is available (F1, F2, F3, ...).
Onboard channels when available are supported, as well as technical channels like the tracker channel.

Multiple channels playback is not supported. Audio selection (language or no commentary) is not supported
so everything is in english.

Application is not translated and only available in english.

## Disclaimer

I have created this app because the official [F1 TV app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.formulaone.production)
does not officially support Android TV and even after sideloading it, it's not usable with a remote.
The official website is also not easily usable with a remote. If in the future an official application
would be available, I will happilly abandonned this one.

This application has only been tested on a up-to-date Nvidia Shield TV 2017 version.

This will allways be a free and open source app and will probably never be on Google Play.

Do what you want with it : use it, modify it or better contribute to this project.
